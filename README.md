## Basic Front End and Back End Project ##
# Used React, Flask, NodeJS/Express, MongoDB, and SQL #

This project came from a tutorial linked here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PppslXOR7TA. The tutorial originally showed how to connect a basic React front-end to a Flask back-end in Python using a local SQL database. Once I implemented that I wanted to try implementing the same back end using NodeJS/Express and MongoDB.

# How to Run the program #
To run the front-end, open a terminal and change the directory to the frontend folder and then use the following commands. 
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

To run the Flask back-end, open a terminal and change the directory to the backendFlask folder and then use the following command.
```
python3 main.py
```

To run the Express back-end, grab the link from your MongoDB database and insert it into the index.js file where it says "mongodb link here". Then open a terminal and change the directory to the backendExpress folder and then us the following commands.
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
